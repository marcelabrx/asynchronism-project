## ADA ITW - FrontEnd

### Final Project - Module 4

My name is Marcela Britos, I am a student of FrontEnd Development at ADA ITW and this is my Final Project of Module 4.

## ðŸ“‘ Project description

This website was developed with knowledge of HTML5 and JAVASCRIPT concepts. In addition, we have used pure CSS and Tailwind CSS, a framework that allows an agile development, based on utility classes that can be easily applied in the code.



This site allows you to publish the work you offer, the platform allows you to add new jobs, edit them, delete them, use different filters, etc. So you can have the best experience when looking for your ideal candidate, I hope you enjoy it! 





This project was made with the Github service, and you can see it through this [link]()

## ðŸ‘€ Views

### Here are some examples of what you can do on this site
There is a home page. Here is an example of how the main page would look like with the preloaded cards, also you can see the filters that you can make according to location, seniority and category. You will also have the option to create a new job or simply go to the main page again. Each card has a button to view the details of the card.

If you want to create a job, this is the form to fill in, If you want to create a job, this is the form you must fill in, each field to complete is important for the job to be as complete and clear as possible. All fields are mandatory, but in case you don't have an image at the moment, one will be preloaded by default until you find the right one!

Este es un ejemplo de lo que serÃ­a el detalle de una tarjeta, con sus respectivos botones para editarla o eliminarla, puedes editar todos los campos disponibles pero recuerda que todos con obligatorios, en el caso que quieras eliminar un trabajo, no hay problema, se te preguntara si quieres eliminarlo completamente mediante una ventana modal.
